#1. The Currency Challenge: Why Automated Tracking?

Exchange rates are affected by a wide range of economic and political factors, resulting in constant fluctuations. For investors, businesses, and analysts:

* **Constant Fluctuations:** make manual tracking impractical and prone to error.

* **The Need for Accuracy:** financial decisions require accurate, real-time data.

* **Lost Opportunities:** delays in obtaining data can lead to missed investment opportunities or increased risk.

Our project aims to overcome these challenges by automating the data collection and analysis process..





#2. Our Innovative Solution: Real-Time EUR/USD Tracking

We offer a comprehensive solution that combines Google Sheets, Google Apps Script, and Tableau (or Looker Studio) technologies to create an automated monitoring and analysis system for the EUR/USD currency pair.

## Key Components of the Solution:

1. **Automated Data Collection:**

* **Tool:** Google Sheets & Google Apps Script

* **Function:** Fetches the EUR/USD exchange rate every 30 minutes.

2. **Historical Data Storage:**

* **Tool:** Google Sheets (USDEUR Summary Sheet)

* **Function:** Records historical data on price, changes, and trend status.

3. **Powerful Business Intelligence:**

* **Tool:** Tableau Public Dashboard

* **Function:** Displays interactive and dynamic insights from the collected data.

#3. In-Depth Look: The Data Engine - Google Sheets & Apps Script

Google Sheets forms the backbone for data collection, storage, and initial analysis. Its capabilities are enhanced by Google Apps Script to automate key tasks.

##3.1. `LIVE_DATA` Sheet: Fetching Real-Time Price

This sheet is used to continuously fetch the latest EUR/USD exchange rate.

* **Function:** Fetches the current price, date and time, and the previous price for the currency pair.
* **Source:** Releases on the powerful `GOOGLEFINANCE` function to fetch real-time financial data.

_**Explanation:** Screenshot showing the `LIVE_DATA` sheet where the latest EUR/USD exchange rate is fetched._

##3.2. `USDEUR Summary` Sheet: Historical Data Record

This sheet is the main repository for all collected historical data points.

* **Function:** Stores each exchange rate record with the date and time, previous rate, daily (or 30-minute) change, and trend status (UP/DOWN/FLAT).
* **`Trend Status` Column:** This column is calculated by comparing the current price to the previous price, providing an immediate view of the trend at each point in time.

_**Explanation:** A screenshot showing the historical data history of the EUR/USD rate in the `USDEUR Summary` sheet._

##3.3. `Statistical Summary` Sheet: Raw Key Performance Indicators

This sheet provides a concise statistical summary of exchange rate data. This is the direct source of the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in the dashboard.

* **Function:** Automatically calculates the latest exchange rate, all-time average price, price volatility (standard deviation), current trend status, and total number of records.
* **Benefits:** Provides a quick overview of the most important metrics without the need to analyze raw data.

**Explanation:** A screenshot showing the statistical summary and raw key performance indicators (KPIs) in the `Statistical Summary` sheet.

## 3.4. Data Automation Using Google Apps Script

This is where the power of automation lies. A custom Google Apps Script fetches and records data regularly, ensuring that our historical log and statistical summaries are always up-to-date.

* **Basic Function:**

1. Reads the latest EUR/USD rate from the `LIVE_DATA` sheet.

2. Calculates the previous rate by looking at the last recorded entry in the `USDEUR Summary`.

3. Adds a new row to the `USDEUR Summary` sheet containing the current timestamp, current rate, previous rate, and other derived metrics. 
4. Ensures that calculated columns (such as daily change and trend status) in `USDEUR Summary` are correctly populated for the new row. 
5. Executes this operation every 30 minutes using a time-driven trigger configured in Google Apps Script.

* **Script Code (`recordHistoricalRate()`):** 

````javascript 
```{js eval=FALSE} 
function recordHistoricalRate() { 
const HISTORY_SHEET_NAME = 'USDEUR_Summary'; 
const LIVE_SHEET_NAME = 'LIVE_DATA'; 

try { 
const ss = SpreadsheetApp. getActiveSpreadsheet(); 
const historySheet = ss. getSheetByName(HISTORY_SHEET_NAME); 
const liveSheet = ss. getSheetByName(LIVE_SHEET_NAME); 

// Get the last row with content in the history sheet to determine where to append the new row 
const lastRowInHistory = historySheet. getLastRow(); 
const newRowIndex = lastRowInHistory + 1; 

// Read the current price from the live data sheet. 
//Assuming EUR_RATE is in cell A1 of LIVE_DATA sheet based on your code snippet 
const EUR_RATE = liveSheet.getRange('A1').getValue(); 

// Get the previous rate from column E (5th column) of the last recorded row in HISTORY_SHEET_NAME. 
// We assume column E in USDEUR_Summary holds the "Current Rate" of the previous entry. 
let previousRate = 0; 
if (lastRowInHistory > 1) { // Ensure there's a previous record to read from (assuming header in row 1) 
previousRate = historySheet. getRange(lastRowInHistory, 5). getValue(); 
} else { 
// If this is the first data entry after headers, previousRate can be set to currentRate or 0 
previousRate = EUR_RATE; 
} 

// Create the new data row to be appended to USDEUR_Summary 
// The structure should match the columns in USDEUR_Summary: 
// A: Metric, B: Last Updated (CET), C: Source Currency, D: Target Currency, E: Exchange Rate, F: Previous Day's Rate, G: 30 minutes Change (%), H: Trend Status 
// Note: Columns G and H will be populated by formulas if they exist in G2:H2 
const rowData = [ 
"USD to EUR Rate", // Column A: Metric 
new Date(), //Column B: Last Updated (CET) - Current timestamp 
"USD", // Column C: Source Currency 
"EUR", // Column D: Target Currency 
EUR_RATE, // Column E: Exchange Rate (Current Rate) 
previousRate // Column F: Previous Day's Rate 
]; 

// Add the row to the history sheet 
historySheet. appendRow(rowData); 

// Copy formulas for '30 minutes Change (%)' and 'Trend Status' to the new row 
// Assuming formulas for these are in columns G and H of row 2 
historySheet.getRange("G2:H2"). copyTo(historySheet.getRange(newRowIndex, 7, 1, 2)); 

Logger.log("Historical record added successfully to " + HISTORY_SHEET_NAME + " at row " + newRowIndex); 

} catch (e) { 
Logger.log("Error recording data: " + e.toString()); 
// Optionally, send an email notification about the error 
// MailApp.sendEmail("your_email@example.com", "Apps Script Error - EUR/USD Tracker", "Error: " + e.toString()); 
}

}

```

_**Detailed Script Explanation:**_

_This script performs the following steps periodically:_

1. _**Select Sheets:** Selects the `USDEUR_Summary` and `LIVE_DATA` sheets in the active data table._

2. _**Fetch Current Price:** Reads the latest EUR/USD price from cell `A1` in the `LIVE_DATA` sheet._

3. _**Fetch Previous Price:** Extracts the price recorded in column 5 (`E`) from the last row added in the `USDEUR_Summary` sheet. If there are no previous records, the previous price is considered the same as the current price to prevent errors.

4. **Set up data for the new row:** Creates a new data row containing a description of the scale, the current date and time, the source and target currencies, the current price, and the previous price.

5. **Add row:** Adds the new row to the `USDEUR_Summary` sheet.

6. **Copy formulas:** Copys the formulas in cells `G2:H2` (for "30 minutes Change (%)" and "Trend Status") to the new row, ensuring these values ​​are automatically calculated for each new entry.

7. **Error logging:** Includes error handling that logs any problems that occur during execution in the `Logger`.

* **Set up the time-driven trigger:**

To run this script automatically every 30 minutes, a time trigger must be set up in Google Apps Script:

1. In the Google Apps Script editor, click the icon 1. Click on the `Triggers` (clock icon) in the left sidebar.

2. Click on `+ Add Trigger` in the bottom right corner.

3. Select the function you want to run: `recordHistoricalRate`.

4. Set the `Event type` to `Time-driven`.

5. Select the `Time-based trigger type` to `Every 30 minutes`.

6. Save the trigger.

**Result:** The data collection and logging process is now fully automated, ensuring your dashboard is regularly updated.
